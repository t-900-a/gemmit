Welcome to gemmit! We have registered your account automatically using your
client certificate.

Subject:
	{{.Cert.Subject.ToRDNSequence}}
SHA-256 Hash:
	{{.Hash}}

Keep this certificate safe! You'll need to back it up and bring it with you to
new devices in order to access your account. Your certificate hash is the only
information we store to identify you, and we cannot help you recover your
account if you lose your certificate.

Let's start by adding some feeds. You can add your own feed or any other hidden gems within Geminispace.

Gemmit is a social news aggregation and web content rating website for the gemini protocol. It enables discovery of highly rated Gemini feeds.

Gemmit seeks not to build a walled garden, but to leverage existing web protocols that respect security through decentralization and privacy.

Feeds are ranked via votes published on Monero.
Votes for the sake of gemmit are defined as: any incoming transaction to a blockchain address that has been associated with an atom feeds or entries respective author(s)

This approach has several benefits.
* immutability: votes can not be taken back
* censorship resistance: votes can not be prevented
* privacy: votes can not be tied back to an identity, unless voluntarily revealed
* monetary: votes act as micropayments to content producers
* composability: votes are not locked or owned by a central service
* auditability: votes can be publicly verified by all
* sovereignty: Content producers own both their content and the associated metadata for voting / payments

Gemmit is open source:
