Gemmit is a social news aggregation and web content rating website for the gemini protocol. It enables discovery of highly rated Gemini feeds.

Gemmit seeks not to build a walled garden, but to leverage existing web protocols that respect security through decentralization and privacy.

Feeds are ranked via votes published on Monero and other public blockchains.
Votes for the sake of gemmit are defined as: any incoming transaction to a blockchain address that has been associated with an atom feeds' or entries' respective author(s)

This approach has several benefits.
* immutability: votes can not be taken back
* censorship resistance: votes can not be prevented (invididual gemmit instances can choose which feeds are shown)
* privacy: vote submissions can not be tied back to an identity, unless voluntarily revealed
* monetary: votes act as micropayments to content producers
* composability: votes are not locked or owned by a central service
* auditability: votes can be publicly verified by all
* sovereignty: Content producers own both their content and the associated metadata for voting / payments
